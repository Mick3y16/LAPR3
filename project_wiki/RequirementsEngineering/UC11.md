# UC11: View Simulation Results#
## Brief Format ##
The user requests the visualization of the results of a simulation. The system displays a list of simulations and prompts the user to select one. The user selects the desired simulation. The system displays the results of the selected simulation and allows the user to export those results into 3 different formats (HTML, CSV and Gnuplot). The user exports the results into one or more formats of his choosing. The system requests the path to save them. The user inserts the path. The system validates it, exports the results and informs the user of the success of the operation.

## Main Success Scenario (or Basic Flow ) ##
1.	The user requests the visualization of the results of a simulation.
2.	The system displays a list of simulations and prompts the user to select one.
3.	The user selects the desired simulation.
4.	The system displays the results of the selected simulation and allows the user to export those results into 3 different file formats (HTML, CSV and Gnuplot).
5.	The user exports the results to HTML.
6.	The system requests the path to save the HTML file.
7.	The user inserts the path.
8.	The system validates it, exports the results and informs the success of the operation.

## Extensions ( or alternative flows ) ##

* *a. The user cancels the visualization of results of a simulation.
    * The use case ends.

* 2a. The system detects that there are no simulations available.
    * 1 The system warns the user of the fact.
    * 2 The use case ends.

* 5a. The user exports the results to CSV.
    * 1 The system requests the path to save the CSV file.
    * 2 The user inserts the path.
    * 3 The system exports the results and informs the success of the operation.
    * 4 The use case continues until canceled.

* 5b. The user exports the results to Gnuplot.
    * 1 The system requests the path to save the Gnuplot file.
    * 2 The user inserts the path.
    * 3 The system exports the results and informs the success of the operation.
    * 4 The use case continues until canceled.

* 5c. The user doesn't export the results.
    * 1 The use canse continues until canceled.

* 8a. The system detects that the path is not valid.
    * 1 The system warns the user of the fact and allows the change.
    * 2 The user doesn't change the path. The use case continues until canceled.
