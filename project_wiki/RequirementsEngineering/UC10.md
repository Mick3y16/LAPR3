#UC10:Perform Network Static Analysis#
## Brief Format ##
The user starts the network static analysis process. The system prompts the user to select the desired vehicles from a list of vehicles. The user selects one or more vehicles. The system requests the user the type of analysis to perform (fastest path or most efficient path). The user selects the desired type. The system prompts the user to select the origin and the destination nodes from the list of nodes. The user selects both nodes. The system shows the results (list of sections the vehicle used along the road network, the traveling time, energy consumption and toll costs) and asks if the user wants to export the data to an HTML file. The user confirms. The system exports the data and informs the user of the success of the operation.

## Main Success Scenario (or Basic Flow ) ##
1. The user starts the network static analysis process.
2. The system prompts the user to select the desired vehicles from a list of vehicles.
3. The user selects one or more vehicles.
4. The system requests the user the type of analysis to perform (fastest path or most efficient path).
5. The user selects the desired type.
6. The system prompts the user to select the origin and the destination nodes from the list of nodes.
7. The user selects both nodes.
8. The system validates the data given, runs the analysis and shows the results (list of sections the vehicles used along the road network, the traveling time, energy consumption and toll costs) and asks if the user wants to export the data to an HTML file.
9. The user confirms.
10. The system requests the path to the file.
11. The user inserts the path.
12. The system validates the path, exports the results and informs the user of the success of the operation.
