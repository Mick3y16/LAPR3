= Drag =

In aerodynamics, drag is a force that acts parallel and in the same direction as the airflow. Its impact is very important in the manufactoring of vehicles. 

The drag force increases with the squared velocity of the vehicle - a vital detail when vehicles approach high speeds.

The lower the drag coefficient, the higher the efficiency between the velocity of the vehicle and the fuel consumption.

To reduce the drag of a vehicle, you can:
* Delete:
** Roof rack
** Mud flaps
** Rear spoiler
** Side mirrors
** Radio antenna
** Windshield wipers

* Fabricate:
** Wheel covers
** Partial grille block
** Under tray
** Fender skirts
** Modified front bumper
** Bottails and Kammbacks


The drag coefficient usually ranges between 0,30 and 0,35 in modern vehicles. In SUVs, it's between 0,35 and 0,45.

The most common way of measuring drag is through the drag area.

The drag area can be defined as the product between the drag coefficient and the area.

It is generally represented as:

Where:
* Cd - Drag Coefficient;
* A - Area.

The necessary force to overcome the drag is described by the following equation:

{{https://bitbucket.org/repo/pqBqye/images/3036416579-F1.png|F1.png}}

Where:
* Fdrag - The necessary force to overcome drag;
* Cd - DragCoefficient;
* œÅ - The fluid's density (1.2 kg/m^3 for air at NTP*);
* A - Area;
* v - Speed.

*Note: NTP stands for Normal Temperature and Pressure


The drag area is the fundamental value that determines the necessary power required for a given cruise speed and it is also a critical parameter to determine the fuel consumption at a steady speed.

From the information described above, it is possible to estimate the new maximum speed of a vehicle:

* estimatedtopspeed - The estimated top speed of the vehicle;
* originaltopspeed - The original top speed of the vehicle;
* newpower - The new power of the vehicle;
* originalpower - The original power of the vehicle.

It is also possible to estimate the necessary power for a maximum target speed:

Where:

* powerrequired - The power required to cruise for the target top speed;
* targetspeed - The target maximum speed of the vehicle;
* originalspeed - The original speed of the vehicle;
* originalpower - The original power of the vehicle.

The drag coefficient can be retrieved by the given drag force formula as:

==Real-Life Examples ==

* An average full-size passanger car can have a drag area of roughly 0.790 m^2.
* Reported drag areas range from 0.47m^2 (Honda Insight 1999) to 2.46m^2 (Hummer H2 2003
